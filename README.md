# Aurelia Botanica

Aurelia Botanica is a command-line tool for calculating essential oil yields from herbs. The program uses ASCII art for an aesthetic touch and provides a simple way to estimate the oil yield based on the weight of the herb.

## Features

- **ASCII Art**: The program displays a banner with the name *Aurelia Botanica* using pyfiglet.
- **Essential Oil Yield Calculator**: You can input the weight of your herb in grams, and the program will calculate the estimated essential oil yield based on different yield percentages (high, medium, low).
- **Command-Line Interface**: A simple CLI that allows you to enter commands for calculating yields and get information about the yield ranges.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyfiglet` library (for ASCII art)

To install the necessary Python libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pyfiglet
